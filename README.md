## Summary
____________________________________
In this project, we try to using a regression Machine Learning model to predict the revenue of movie with its information.

We use python-selenium to collect data from [boxofficemojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)'s reports and use these data as input data. 

Our predict model will be comming soon.

## Crawler
____________________________________
As you see, in this project, we used *selenium* to collect data. You also use any tool else, but find an element by **xpath** is more easier than try to make things right with *beautifulsoup* or *scrapy* as well.

An example, with each movie, we need to collect 13 features, it's just 13 lines with selenium but with beautifulsoup, 13 lines help you collect about 5 features.
